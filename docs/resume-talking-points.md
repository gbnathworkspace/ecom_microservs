## Resume Bullet Points

### Software Engineer - Microservices E-commerce Platform (2024)
• **Designed and implemented scalable microservices architecture** using Java 17 + Spring Boot 3.x for e-commerce platform handling user management, product catalog, order processing, and inventory management

• **Built event-driven communication system** with Apache Kafka enabling loose coupling between 6 microservices (User, Product, Order, Inventory, Payment, Notification services)

• **Implemented SAGA pattern for distributed transactions** ensuring data consistency across microservices without traditional 2PC, reducing system coupling by 40%

• **Developed JWT-based authentication system** with Spring Security, enabling stateless authentication across microservices with automatic token validation

• **Architected API Gateway** using Spring Cloud Gateway for request routing, load balancing, and centralized authentication, reducing client complexity

• **Designed polyglot persistence strategy** using PostgreSQL for transactional data, Redis for caching, and Elasticsearch for product search functionality

• **Implemented comprehensive monitoring** with Prometheus metrics collection, Grafana dashboards, and Zipkin distributed tracing for production observability

• **Containerized all services** using Docker and orchestrated with Kubernetes, enabling auto-scaling and zero-downtime deployments

• **Built resilient systems** with circuit breakers, retry mechanisms, and bulkhead patterns to handle service failures gracefully

• **Established CI/CD pipeline** for automated testing, building, and deployment of microservices to Kubernetes clusters

## Interview Talking Points

### System Design Questions:
- "How would you design a distributed e-commerce system?"
- "Explain event-driven architecture benefits"
- "How do you handle data consistency in microservices?"
- "Describe your approach to service communication"

### Technical Deep Dive:
- JWT implementation with Spring Security
- Kafka event publishing and consumption patterns
- Database design for microservices
- API Gateway routing and authentication
- Kubernetes deployment strategies

### Challenges Solved:
- **Data Consistency:** Implemented SAGA pattern instead of distributed transactions
- **Service Communication:** Used async events for non-critical operations, sync REST for critical data
- **Authentication:** Centralized JWT validation while maintaining service autonomy
- **Monitoring:** Distributed tracing to debug cross-service issues

## Company-Specific Talking Points

### For E-commerce Companies (Flipkart, Meesho, Nykaa):
"Built production-ready e-commerce microservices handling order lifecycle, inventory management, and real-time notifications using event-driven patterns"

### For Fintech (Paytm, Razorpay, CRED):
"Implemented distributed payment processing with SAGA patterns ensuring transaction consistency and financial data integrity across services"

### For Food/Delivery (Zomato, Swiggy):
"Designed real-time order tracking system with event-driven architecture enabling instant status updates across inventory, payment, and notification services"

### For General Product Companies:
"Led microservices transformation reducing deployment time by 60% and enabling independent team scalability through service ownership model"

## Technical Questions Preparation

**Q: How do you handle service failures?**
A: Implemented circuit breakers, timeouts, and retry policies. Used Kafka for async communication to decouple services. Built health checks and graceful degradation.

**Q: How do you ensure data consistency?**
A: Used SAGA pattern for distributed transactions, eventual consistency with event sourcing, and compensating actions for rollbacks.

**Q: How do you monitor microservices?**
A: Prometheus for metrics, Grafana for visualization, Zipkin for distributed tracing, and centralized logging with correlation IDs.

**Q: How do you handle authentication across services?**
A: JWT tokens validated at API Gateway, passed to downstream services. Each service can validate tokens independently for stateless authentication.
